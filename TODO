* when panel.energy_fJ becomes very large, increment is not accurate

* RAM can do 1 read + 1 write per cycle, not compatible with 6T single-port

* SRAM cost function should take into account write latency (impacts energy)

* SRAM should do column multiplexing before sensing

* leakage depends on temperature
