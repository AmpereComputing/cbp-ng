* manual

* compiler flag to deactivate transistor and energy counting

* concat(array1,array2)

* timing of reg should be rounded to next clock cycle

* is there a SRAM cost function that makes the SRAM behavior monotonic?

* RAM can do 1 read + 1 write per cycle, not compatible with 6T single-port

* wire segmentation prioritizes delay over energy, is this what we want?

* SRAM should model column multiplexing before sensing

* SRAM cost function should take into account write latency (impacts energy)

* leakage depends on total number of transistor fins

* leakage depends on temperature
