* compiler flag to deactivate transistor and energy counting

* is there a SRAM cost function that makes the SRAM behavior monotonic?

* RAM can do 1 read + 1 write per cycle, not compatible with 6T single-port

* wire segmentation prioritizes delay over energy, is this what we want?

* SRAM should model column multiplexing before sensing

* leakage depends on total number of transistor fins

* leakage depends on temperature
