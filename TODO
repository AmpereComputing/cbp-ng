* missing hardware models
 - ROM
 - carry-save adder
 - integer multiplier
 - (floating-point operators)
 - popcount
 
* missing operations: >, <, >=, <=, *, <<, >>, %, /

* currently, RAM writes are free wrt SRAM bandwidth (single R/W port)

* spatial location for values + corresponding wire delay/energy

* general reduction primitive for class arr

* general scan primitive for class arr (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum)

* CAM?
