* ROM

* missing operations (>, <, >=, <=, <<, >>, %, /)

* optimize the priority encoder

* integer FMA

* general reduction primitive for class arr

* general scan primitive for class arr

* static power

* hashed perceptron example

* user manual

To do eventually (but not priority):
* RAM can do 1 read + 1 write per cycle, not compatible with 6T single-port
* floating point
