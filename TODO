* is there a SRAM cost function that makes the SRAM behavior monotonic?

* RAM can do 1 read + 1 write per cycle, not compatible with 6T single-port

* wire segmentation prioritizes delay over energy, is this what we want?

* SRAM: should we model 4:1 column multiplexing before the sense amp?

* leakage is suspiciously low
