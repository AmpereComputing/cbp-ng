* missing hardware models
 - flip-flop (for class reg)
 - ROM
 - carry-save adder
 - integer multiplier
 - (floating-point operators)
 
* missing operations: >, <, >=, <=, *, <<, >>, %, /

* SRAM energy/delay/area model is for single R/W port; class ram currently does not model this constraint

* extend class ram to hold arr objects

* spatial location for values + corresponding wire delay/energy

* general reduction primitive for class arr

* general scan primitive for class arr (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum)

* utility for printing the energy of a function
